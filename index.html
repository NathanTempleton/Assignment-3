    <u><h3 id ="intro">Intro</h3></u>
    <p id ="intro-2">For the topic on a career in computer science, I chose a career in game development. Game development is as the name suggests a career where you work to develop games. As a game developer you will most likely either work for 3rd party or 1rst party video game companies, or as an indie developer. The reason why I have chosen this career for this assignment is due to the fact that I have always enjoyed video games, and have been interested to learn about how the people behind the games make them.</p>

    <u><h3 id ="job-sum">Summary of Job</h3></u>
    <p id ="job-sum-2">Your responsibilities as a game developer is many things, and you will need many different skillsets to accomplish them. As a game developer you will be expected to help plan the game you will be working on, by helping with things like constructing the story, environments, characters, scoring, and the progression. You will help to plan out how you will build the game and break it down into smaller pieces by setting milestones, creating scheduled timelines,  and creating prototypes of the game. You will also likely be working together with 3d/2d artists to help create artwork and animations for your game. You need to have good cooperation so you can help with the work, and make sure their work coincides with the code you are writing. As a game developer who is working on the game, you should be able to code so you can actually create the game and make it work. You will have to work on certain aspects of a game from making a health bar work, to coding how enemies react. During and after the games development you will likely be in charge of having to debug and test the game, since no one wants to play a broken game. In all cycles of development you will likely have bugs in your code, this could be anything from game breaking to a small error like being able to clip through a certain area. In order to make sure your game is in a good state you should be looking through your own code for bugs, and testing the game, then once you find an error you should go back to the code and fix it. You might be in charge of designing add ons/ dlc for your game after development, so even after your done the game theres no telling if you’ll have to design another part of it.</p>

    </div>
    <p id ="job-sum-3">In order to become a game developer it’s recommended or required that you have a bachelors degree in the field of computer science, there’s also plenty of programs for game development in college or university. Game development is a large industry that is growing every day due to the increase in people playing games and those who are wanting to design them, aswell organises like the BLS expect a 30% growth in the industry by 2026. Frequently we see new upcoming studios designing games at announcement trailers like at e3, and with the sales going up more than ever, we can assume that the career will continue to prosper in the future. With the video game industry being as big as it is currently we can imagine with it’s increasing popularity that it will become a staple job in computer science in the future. The median salary of game developers is about 101,800$ annually, the 10th percentile of game developers make about 59,900 annually. The highest earners get about 160,100$, aswell game developers usually get full time working benefits including medical, dental, vision, and more. After all I have seen I would be interested in this career and could possibly consider it. I enjoy video games so thats why I chose this, aswell the job seems like it wouldn’t be the same everyday and would be more entertaining. Although I came across cons along my way like how during crunch time for games, workers will be put under harsh time constraints and be forced to work for long hours. Also the salary can be low compared to other computer science jobs, while still having a normally reasonable pay. So in the end this career has many pros and cons, but this is still a career that interests me and I might consider it.</p>
    <u><h3 id ="education">Education</h3></u>
    <p id ="education-2">There are many different programs at algonquin college that could get you into game development like computer science and computer programming, but today i’ll talk about their game development program. In order to get into this program you need:</p>
    <div id ="education-3">
      <ul> 
        <li>English, Grade 12 (ENG4C or equivalent)</li>
        <li>Mathematics Grade 12 (MAP4C or equivalent) </li>
        <li> Mathematics Grade 12 (MCT4C is highly recommended).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p id ="education-4">Physics is recommended along with it being recommended to have computer skills before going into this course. A testing fee of 50$ is charged each time to apply, and the additional cost of education throughout all your 3 years should be around 2,900$. All in all the program fees will come to a grand total of around $20,513.00.  For your first year you should have the courses Design Thinking, Communications I,Digital Imaging I,Game Design Foundations, Programming Fundamentals I, and Technical Mathematics for Game Development. Additional things you should have to complete the degree, are you required to bring your own device, and you should already have a strong foundation in mathematics. It should take you around 3 years to complete this course, where you will learn the many requirements to become a game developer and learn many new skills.</p>

    <p id ="vocation-2"> This career will bring out my vocation of god since I will be able to show my vocations through the medium of video games. I have been playing and enjoying video games for my whole life, as well as having skills that apply to game development, so this could be one of the careers that I could use my vocation for. I have skills in art, programming, and creativity so this could be a good career for me if I feel like it is suitable in the future. Video games usually bring enjoyment to people as well as inspiration, so by building video games I could help inspire others in many different ways, and to bring happiness to others which can help many different peoples lives. The inspiration could help others to use their vocations as well and help the world with that, since inspiration is something that can change lives. My vocation could help me choose appropriate priorities, since it will help me to understand what it is that I need to set my sights on in life. For example when selecting courses or jobs in the future I can know which courses will benefit my vocation so I don’t waste my energy/time on stuff that won’t help me out in the long run. Also I can use these vocations to help out people in their daily lives, since I can use my special skills to help out those who may not have them or are having trouble in life. For example helping someone out with a computer issue or drawing out something for them if they need it. I can also use my knowledge of my vocation to make sure that I set my priorities straight and don’t set it on the wrong things or people that will impact me in a negative way if I continue to have them around me, so in the end I can make sure to fulfill my duties and live my life to the fullest.</p>
    <u><h3 id ="conclusion">Conclusion</h3></u>
    <p id ="conclusion-2">The job in game development is one that i will definitely keep my eyes on after this assignment and is one that is very interesting to me. So in the end being a game developer is a lot of hard work but is also an interesting and unique job.</p>
